# retraction-seeker

This project is WIP attempt at gcode generator that produces array of towers with various retraction settings between them.

* X axis changes retraction distance (by default 1.0 - 5.5 mm in 0.25 mm steps)
* Y axis changes retraction speed (by default 10.0 - 55.0 mm/s in 2.5 mm/s steps)
* Z axis changes temperature (by default 210 to 190 in 5C steps, 5mm each step)

The generated values for each of the axis are listed in the g-code and should be used as a key when observing the platter (ret_d_steps, ret_spd_steps, temp_steps).

All parameters of the generated g-code can be influneced by editing a settings.json file placed next to the script (see settings.json.example as an example).

Default parameters are set to similar values that prusa i3 mk3 would expect.

NOTE: Currently, the generated E axis movement is 7% more than expected (when compared to Slic3r generated g-code). Since this is a crucial part of the generation, more effort will be put to get the extrusion factor lined up correctly.
